# file_sorter
An app that moves downloaded files from a source directory to a destination directory. 
Idea came when downloading multiple school pdfs and then having to manually move them to the right location.
Instead this app looks a at ex. Downloads dir and moves newly created .pdf files to a destination directory.
The config.txt file is where you add new file tpyes.
